							If we begin from the beginning we will realise that our life itself is an opportunity given to us.  We have been brought to life from a state of non-existence.  We have no clue where we were a hundred years ago and where we will be a hundred years hence.  We don't even know what unknown force brought us into existence.  We must be grateful that we have been given this opportunity to experience life, explore it, understand it and add to its evolution, even if it were only for a limited period.  The opportunity to exist is our first golden opportunity. 

							Once we see that life itself is an opportunity, then whatever happens within life is also a series of opportunities.  Life is then lived within the context called opportunity.  Everything is then viewed keeping this context in the background.  The mind then has a filter through which it can perceive life.  It then realises that every moment is an opportune moment.  Whether the moment is good or bad does not matter.  'Behind the challenge or problem lies an opportunity' is the thought process of such a mindset.  The enduring question would be 'what opportunity is this moment, is this person, is this situation presenting to me'.  When this question is kept foremost in the mind it will begin to generate its own answers.  You would then have entered the realm of the opportunity mindset.

							We need to have a holistic approach while creating an opportunity mindset.  It cannot be in business and mega deals alone.  It has to encompass all areas of life: relationships, profession, emotional, spiritual, intellectual and behavioral.  We have to practice looking for opportunities at all possible moments.  We need to start at the most basic level and not brush off opportunities that our mind presents to us as small and inconsequential.  If we keep rejecting opportunities we will be sending wrong signals to our brain and it will stop supporting us.  Accept whatever comes in the beginning.  The quality will improve with practice.

							Opportunities don't come knocking on our door.  But that is how it appears on hindsight.  If you did not see an opportunity, it never existed for you in the first place.  Looking back you will notice it and feel that you missed it.  Feeling that we missed an opportunity will cause regret and depress us.  Why did I not notice it is a question that may haunt us?  It was because we did not create a mindset that would have enabled noticing such opportunities.  We just need to work on improving our opportunity seeking radar.
